Music Recommendation system based on facial emotion detection
This project aims to develop a music recommendation system based on facial emotion recognition. The system captures the facial expressions of the user in real-time and determines their emotional state using the FER library. Based on the user's emotions, the system recommends a suitable genre of music to listen to, fetched from an online music database.
